## Welcome to Giovanni Furlan's GitHub page! ðŸ”¥

Hello there! I am a Back End developer ðŸ’» passionate about crafting robust solutions using my expertise in C#, SQL Server, Entity Framework and Powershell. 
When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me indulging in my favourite TV series or diving into the latest video game releases. 
Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
